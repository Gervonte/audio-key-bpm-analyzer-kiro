# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to upload hip hop instrumental audio files and automatically analyze them to determine the musical key and beats per minute (BPM) using essentia.js algorithms. The web application will provide a simple interface for file upload and display the analysis results in a user-friendly format.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want to upload a hip hop instrumental file, so that I can quickly determine its key and BPM for my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the web application THEN the system SHALL display a file upload interface
2. WHEN a user selects an audio file THEN the system SHALL validate that the file is in a supported audio format (MP3, WAV, FLAC, M4A)
3. WHEN a user uploads a valid audio file THEN the system SHALL process the file using essentia.js and analyze its musical properties
4. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL display the detected key and BPM prominently
5. IF the file format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating supported formats

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want to see accurate key and BPM detection results, so that I can trust the analysis for my music production decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes an audio file THEN the system SHALL detect the musical key using essentia.js key detection algorithms with reasonable accuracy
2. WHEN the system analyzes an audio file THEN the system SHALL detect the BPM using essentia.js tempo estimation algorithms with reasonable accuracy (within Â±2 BPM tolerance)
3. WHEN displaying the key THEN the system SHALL show both the key name (e.g., "C Major", "A Minor") and the key signature
4. WHEN displaying the BPM THEN the system SHALL show the tempo as a whole number
5. IF the analysis fails or produces uncertain results THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error or uncertainty message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want a responsive and intuitive interface, so that I can easily use the tool on different devices and get results quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on any device THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
2. WHEN a user uploads a file THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator during analysis
3. WHEN the analysis is in progress THEN the system SHALL prevent multiple simultaneous uploads
4. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL allow the user to upload another file without page refresh
5. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL present the key and BPM in a clear, readable format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want reasonable file size limits and processing times, so that I can efficiently analyze my instrumental files without long waits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a file THEN the system SHALL enforce a maximum file size limit of 50MB
2. WHEN processing an audio file THEN the system SHALL complete analysis within 30 seconds for files up to 10 minutes long
3. IF a file exceeds the size limit THEN the system SHALL display an error message with the size restriction
4. IF processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating the analysis is still in progress
5. WHEN analysis fails due to file corruption or processing errors THEN the system SHALL display a helpful error message
